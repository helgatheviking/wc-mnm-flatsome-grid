# WooCommerce Mix and Match - Flatsome Grid

Use Flatsome markup for WooCommerce Mix and Match Product grid layout.

### What's This?

Experimental mini-extension for [WooCommerce Mix and Match](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-mix-and-match-products//) that provides integration with the [Flatsome theme](http://flatsome3.uxthemes.com/). In particular, this will override Mix and Match's grid layout templates to with templates that try to mimic the Flatsome shop loop markup.

### Important

1. Requires WooCommerce Mix and Match 1.3.0+.
2. This is proof of concept and not officially supported in any way.

### How to Use

Upload and activate this plugin. 

### Note

Ideally, this plugin should only be active when the Flatsome Theme is activated. It could cause problems if the theme is changed and it is would be recommended to deactivate this plugin should you change themes.
